Thermostat
===

This is a project to build a thermostat using Javascript, HTML/CSS, jQuery and API's

## Challenge requirements

1. Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
2. You can increase the temp with an up function
3. You can decrease the temp with a down function
4. The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
5. If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
6. If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
7. Power saving mode is on by default
8. You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
9. You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

## User Stories

### User Story 1
```
As a user,  
So that I can know the temperature,  
I want a thermostat that is at 20 degrees
```
### User Story 2
```
As a user,  
So that I can be cooler or warmer,  
I want to increase and decrease the temperature with an up and down function
```
### User Story 3
```
As a user,
So that it never gets too cold,
I want to set a minimum temperature of 10 degrees
```
### User Story 4
```
As a user,
So I can have a power saving mode for max temperature,
I want to have a temp of 25 when on and 32 when off
```
### User Story 5
```
As a user,
So I can save power,
I want power saving mode to be on as a default
```
### User Story 6
```
As a user,
So I can put my temperature back to 20,
I want to be able to reset temperature to default with a button
```
### User Story 7
```
As a user,
So I can ask about the thermostats current energy usage,
I want to be able to see 'low-usage'for <18 degrees, 'medium-usage' for 18-25 and 'high-usage' for >=25
```
### User Story 8
```
As a user,
So I can see with colours my energy usage
I want the the interface to have low = green, medium = black, high = red
```
